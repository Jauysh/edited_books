## Part 2: Practical Programming Tasks (15 minutes, 12 points)
**Instructions:** Choose **TWO** out of the three tasks below. Write complete C++ programs.

### Task A: Array Operations
Write a C++ program that:
1. Declares an array of 5 integers
2. Reads values from the user
3. Calculates and displays the sum of all elements
4. Finds and displays the maximum value

**Space for your code:**
```cpp








```

### Task B: String Manipulation
Write a C++ program that:
1. Reads a string from the user
2. Counts and displays the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u)
3. Replaces all spaces with hyphens '-'
4. Displays the modified string

**Space for your code:**
```cpp








```

### Task C: Two-dimensional Array
Write a C++ program that:
1. Declares a 3x3 integer matrix
2. Reads values from the user
3. Calculates and displays the sum of the main diagonal elements
4. Displays the matrix in a formatted way

**Space for your code:**
```cpp








```

## Part 3: Theory Application (10 minutes, 10 points)
**Instructions:** Answer both questions completely.

### Question 1: Real-world Application (5 points)
Describe how you would use composite data types to represent daily electricity consumption data for a household over one month. Specify:
- Which data types you would use
- How you would structure the data
- Why composite types are necessary for this task

**Your answer:**



### Question 2: Programming Concepts (5 points)
Explain the difference between representing strings as:
- char arrays (char[])
- string type

Include at least two advantages of each approach and when you would prefer one over the other.

**Your answer:**
