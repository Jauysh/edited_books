        "\n",

        "To use memory efficiently and meet the needs of various applications, several integer and floating-point variations exist, differing in the amount of allocated memory and, consequently, in their range of values.\n",

        "For example, in versions of programming languages where the compiler supports only 2-byte (16-bit) integers—such as *Borland C++* or *Turbo Pascal 7.0*—the integer type includes the range:\n",

For example, quantities such as *mass (m)*, *length (l)*, *area (S)*, *volume (V)*, *acceleration due to gravity (g ≈ 9.8 m/s²)*, and the *irrational number π ≈ 3.14* are all used in scientific contexts.\n",

        "A **variable** is a quantity whose value can change during program execution. Every variable has a name, a value, and a data type.\n",
        "A variable’s name (for example, *m, l, S, V, delta*) is used to reference it in the program. During execution, each variable either holds a specific value (e.g., 105 or –36) or has an undefined value.\n",

        "<DataType> <Identifiers>;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "The range of values for these types will be discussed in subsequent sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **constant** is a quantity whose value cannot change during program execution.\n",
        "The type of a constant is implicitly determined by the way it is written.\n",
        "For example, `10` is an integer constant, while `10.0` is a floating-point constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "For clarity, constants may also have symbolic names.\n",
        "The general form of a constant declaration is:\n",
        "\n",

        "3. Some data types are predefined and available in any program — for example, in Pascal: `integer` and `real`; in C++: `int` and `float`.\n",
