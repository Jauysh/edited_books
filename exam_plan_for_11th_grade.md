     a) integer
     b) boolean
     c) array
     d) char

2. **Array Declaration**
   - What is the correct way to declare a one-dimensional array of 10 integers in C++?
     a) int array[10];
     b) array int[10];
     c) int[10] array;
     d) array[10] int;

3. **String Representation**
   - How is the end of a string represented in C++ when using char arrays?
     a) '\n'
     b) '\0'
     c) 'end'
     d) 'stop'

4. **Array Indexing**
   - In C++, array indices start from:
     a) 0
     b) 1
     c) -1
     d) Programmer's choice

5. **Data Type Identification**
   - Which of these represents composite data?
     a) 3.14
     b) "Hello World"
     c) true
     d) 'A'

### Part 2: Practical Programming Tasks (15 minutes)
**Choose 2 out of 3 tasks**

**Task A: Array Operations**
Write a C++ program that:
1. Declares an array of 5 integers
2. Reads values from the user
3. Calculates and displays the sum of all elements
4. Finds and displays the maximum value

**Task B: String Manipulation**
Write a C++ program that:
1. Reads a string from the user
2. Counts and displays the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u)
3. Replaces all spaces with hyphens '-'
4. Displays the modified string

**Task C: Two-dimensional Array**
Write a C++ program that:
1. Declares a 3x3 integer matrix
2. Reads values from the user
3. Calculates and displays the sum of the main diagonal elements
4. Displays the matrix in a formatted way

### Part 3: Theory Application (10 minutes)
**Short Answer Questions (2 questions, 5 minutes each)**

1. **Real-world Application**
   Describe how you would use composite data types to represent daily electricity consumption data for a household over one month. Specify:
   - Which data types you would use
   - How you would structure the data
   - Why composite types are necessary for this task

2. **Programming Concepts**
   Explain the difference between representing strings as:
   - char arrays (char[])
   - string type
   Include at least two advantages of each approach and when you would prefer one over the other.

## Sample Solutions (For Teacher Reference)

### Part 1 Sample Answers:
1. c) array
2. a) int array[10];
3. b) '\0'
4. a) 0
5. b) "Hello World"

### Part 2 Sample Code (Task A):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5];
    int sum = 0, max;
    
    // Read values
    cout << "Enter 5 integers: ";
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    
    // Calculate sum and find max
    max = arr[0];
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
        if(arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    
    cout << "Sum: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Maximum: " << max << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This exam plan ensures comprehensive coverage of the composite data types theory while maintaining the 35-minute timeframe and including both theoretical understanding and practical application components.
